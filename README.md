# Scripts for lwe-estimator

The purpose of this repository is to reproduce a part of security estimation numbers provided in [Tab.1 in Homomorphic Encryption Standard](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/939).

We focus on the ternary distritbuion, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}^n, where $n$ is known as the ring dimension.



# Parameters

We use the followings:

 - lwe-estimator: commit hash 560525

 - key distsitbuion: ternary distribution (w/o hamming weight)

 - ring dimension: n

 - ciphertext modulus parameter: q

 - standard deviation of the error distribution: \sigma = 8/\sqrt{2 \pi} \approx 3.2

 - cost model: BKZ.sieve

# Prerequisite

  - [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)


# Run the scripts

## Clone this repo.

## 1. Specify the location that sage scripts are saved

Our scripts internally generates a sage script that is subsequently taken to `./lwe-estimator/estimator.py` as input. To do so, we need to modify `config.txt` to specify a directory where the sage script is saved. (`/tmp/sage_scripts` is specified by default.)
The following script makes the directory if that is not exist.

    sh init.sh


## 2. Run the estimator

    sh run_estimate_all_params.sh 

The `run_estimate_all_params.sh` internally executes `estimate_sec_bkz_sieve.sh`.
The `estimate_sec_bkz_sieve` takes the ring dimension (logN) and the ciphertext modulus (logQ) as input, generates a corresponding sage script, and returns estimated security levels based on several attacks.
  

If you want to cleanup the sage scripts, run the following:

    sh clean.sh
